In a room where echoes linger still,
A sunbeam's touch has lost its will.
Woven tapestries of yesteryears,
Hold the weight of unshed tears.

The whisper of the falling leaves,
Recalls forgotten summer eves.
A subtle scent in evening air,
Marks an absence ever there.

The gray that wraps the sky's expanse,
Mimics the hue of missed romance.
A tune that's hummed by distant star,
Pulls the heartstrings from afar.

These walls of glass, both dark and clear,
Hold memories that we keep near.
The dance of shadows tells the tale,
Of laughter gone, turned thin and frail.

Each room a vault for love and loss,
Guarded by time's invisible cross.
Here, both joy and sorrow dwell,
In each forgotten story's shell.

I sit amidst this layered haze,
Caught in a long, reflective gaze.
In this quiet, both voices blendâ€”
Two kindred spirits, around me bend.

A still-life painted by regret,
Framed in moments we can't forget.
A silent choir in the soul's expanse,
Singing the hymns of missed chance.
