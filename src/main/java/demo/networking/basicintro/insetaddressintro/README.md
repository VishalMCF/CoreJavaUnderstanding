## Introduction

In Java, the `InetAddress` class is used for working with IP addresses and host names. It provides methods for resolving host names into IP addresses and vice versa. This code demonstrates how to use `InetAddress` for these purposes, handling both valid and invalid host cases.

---

## Code Explanation

### Main Method

In the `main` method, we execute two demo methods:
- `execute_demo_for_InetAddress_concepts_if_host_is_valid()`
- `execute_demo_for_InetAddress_concepts_if_host_is_invalid()`

These methods showcase the use of `InetAddress` in different scenarios.

### Valid Host

```java
public static void execute_demo_for_InetAddress_concepts_if_host_is_valid() {
    try {
        InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("www.youtube.com");
        System.out.println("Youtube Host address: " + address.getHostAddress());
        System.out.println("Youtube Host name: " + address.getHostName());
        address = InetAddress.getByName("www.google.com");
        System.out.println("Google Host address: " + address.getHostAddress());
        System.out.println("Google Host name: " + address.getHostName());
    } catch (UnknownHostException exception) {
        System.out.println("Could not find any host address for youtube and google...");
    }
}
```

In this method, we provide a valid host name, such as "www.youtube.com" and "www.google.com." We use `InetAddress.getByName()` to resolve these host names into IP addresses and retrieve their host names. The results are printed to the console.

### Invalid Host

```java
public static void execute_demo_for_InetAddress_concepts_if_host_is_invalid() {
    try {
        InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIHOQ");
        System.out.println("Host address: " + address.getHostAddress());
        System.out.println("Host name: " + address.getHostName());
    } catch (UnknownHostException exception) {
        System.out.println("Could not find any host address");
    }
}
```

In this method, we provide an invalid host name, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIHOQ." We attempt to resolve this invalid host name using `InetAddress.getByName()`. Since it is not a valid host name, we catch the `UnknownHostException` and print an error message.

## Running the Code

To run this code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer.

2. Clone or download this repository.

3. Navigate to the repository directory using the command line.

4. Compile and run the code using the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac InetAddressDemo.java
   java InetAddressDemo
   ```

   You should see the output demonstrating the use of `InetAddress` for both valid and invalid hosts.
